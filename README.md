## Credits

- I started this project in 22/09/2022 it's hard to know exect time until I finish because I started from scratch, I checked "LOVE RUNNING" and "Coders Coffeehouse" presented by our teachers/mentors.
Today 29/09/2022 I writing this <i>README.md</i> and I am proud with my work.

### Content

- I am 100% sure that my work is not accurate but I checked watching again videos presented by mentors and I am going to dig deep to understand more.
- I used copy-paste during the project just for snipping some helpful content mentioned below:

    - [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
    - [Google-Map-Generator](https://google-map-generator.com/)
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    <i>Site below says  <b>Not secure or Dangerous</b> when accessing the the link</i>
    - [Mock-Up-Generator](http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php)
 
 - I've looked after to understand much better the way how code is working using the link below:
 
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

  - I got all the majorities of ideas from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) but I applied much more modifications and different meaning.

### Media

  - I found during the coding of this project loads of issues for view in different screen sizes.
  
  - All the pictures used in this <i>website</i> are under my ownership.

  - Template for this <i>README.md</i> is [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) property, I TAXISA2B, I am using only for presentation and I changed the content only for learning purpose.
  - Text was written by me, person who developed this website no copy-paste taken from different sources.

### <i> Validator Testing</i>

- HTML
  - I could found minor errors for mistyping or adding to many open tags or forgetting to close tags [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)

  - After careful look I fixed all of them and now performances are after 95%.

  - I could found minor errors for mistyping or adding to many open tags or forgetting to close tags [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### <i>Unfixed Bugs</i>

- Couple of issues for smaller screen size, I fixed big majority, Google DevTools asked for some <i>json</i> files and that's new for me.
 Some of the notions probably will become easier in the next chapters.

## Testing

- Using the Lighthouse tests I could see lots of issues for viewing pictures in different resolution, in big proportion I applied changes. But some of the issues are related to <i><b>json</b></i>

- I used <b>DevTools</b> offered by <b>Google</b> I applied all the changes and I wrote everything in <b>Gitpod</b> where is an internal <b>Visual Studio Code</b>

- For applying all the changes in <b>Gitpod</b> and check how website responding, I used the server mentioned by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) in online learning process.

## Deployment

- After finishing my project I followed cople of easy stepts:
  - I added any page or modified page to git (<b>git add .</b>)
  - I committed any Update followed by relevant information (<b>git commit -m "...relevant message..."</b>)
  - I pushed all the work to <i>GitHub</i> using (<b>git push</b>)
  - After we see our site available in <i>GitHub Website</i>
